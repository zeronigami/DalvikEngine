 ## About Dalvik/ART

- **Dalvik:** Dalvik is Android's original process virtual machine that executes `.dex` (Dalvik Executable) bytecode. It was designed to run efficiently on devices with limited memory and CPU resources.  
- **ART (Android Runtime):** ART is the successor to Dalvik, replacing just-in-time (JIT) compilation with ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for faster app execution and better memory management.  

This module tweaks the runtime environment to improve speed, memory usage, and overall system performance on Android devices
